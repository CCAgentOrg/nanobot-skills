# XPost

## Core Principles

X posts perform best when they are:
- **Concise** - Get to the point quickly
- **Engaging** - Ask questions, use hooks, create curiosity
- **Visual** - Use line breaks, emojis strategically
- **Actionable** - Include clear CTAs when relevant

## Post Structure

### Hook → Value → CTA (Optional)

1. **Hook (1-2 lines)** - Grab attention immediately
   - Questions: "Ever wonder why...?"
   - Bold statements: "I just shipped something new"
   - Numbers/data: "3 things I learned..."

2. **Value (3-5 lines)** - Deliver on the hook
   - Keep sentences short
   - Use active voice
   - One idea per line

3. **CTA (Optional, 1 line)** - What should they do?
   - "What's your take?"
   - "RT if you agree"
   - "Link in comments"

## Formatting Best Practices

- Use line breaks for readability (2-3 sentences max per line)
- 1-2 emojis max per post (don't overdo it)
- Capitalize first word of each line for emphasis
- Keep under 280 characters (use character counter)
- Use hashtags sparingly (1-3 relevant ones)

## Content Types

### Announcements
```

[What it does in 2-3 lines]

[How it helps/solves problem]

[Link or "Check it out"]
```

### Updates
```
Update on [project name]:

✅ [what's done]
🚧 [in progress]
📅 [next milestone]

```

### Tips/Learnings
```
[Number] things I learned about [topic]:

```

### Opinion
```
[Strong opinion about topic]

Here's why:

[Reason 1]
[Reason 2]

[Question to audience]
```

## Thread Structure

1. **First post** - Strong hook + outline of what's coming
2. **Middle posts** - One main idea each, continue numbering if appropriate
3. **Final post** - Summary + CTA + hashtags

Thread template:
```
🧵 A thread on [topic]:

1/8 [Hook + first point]

2/8 [Second point]

[continue...]

8/8 [Summary + CTA]

[hashtags]
```

## Hashtags

Use 1-3 relevant hashtags at the end:
- Broad: #AI #Coding #DevTools
- Specific: #Python #OpenSource
- Community: #BuildInPublic #IndieHackers
