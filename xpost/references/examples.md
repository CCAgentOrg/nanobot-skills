# Post Examples

## Example 1: Product Launch

🚀 zai-quota v1.1.0 is live!

Real-time Z.AI GLM Coding Plan usage monitoring with:
→ Plan tier detection (Lite/Pro/Max)
→ Token usage tracking (5hr rolling)
→ Monthly time-based quotas

Simple. Clean. Works.

## Example 2: Learning/Tips

3 things I learned about building AI skills:

1. Start with concrete examples
Don't build in abstraction. Real use cases guide everything.

2. Keep it concise
Context window is expensive. Every token must earn its place.

3. Ship iteratively
v0.1 beats v1.0 that never ships.

Save this for later 📌

## Example 3: Update

Update on nanobot-skills:

✅ zai-quota v1.1.0 released
🚧 youtube-recommender testing
📅 github-watcher next sprint

The goal: simple, useful skills that just work.

What would you like to see?

## Example 4: Opinion

Skills are the new libraries.

We used to npm install functionality. Now we install expertise into our AI agents.

The pattern:
1. Define a workflow
2. Package it as a skill
3. Share it with the world

The stack is shifting from code → knowledge.

Thoughts?

## Example 5: Engagement Question

What's the hardest part of shipping a new project?

For me it's always:
→ Documentation
→ Testing edge cases
→ Actually clicking "publish"

## Example 6: Behind the Scenes

Spent the weekend refactoring zai-quota.

Removed:
→ 24h token tracking
→ Tool usage section
→ Complex output formatting

Result:
→ Simpler code
→ Faster execution
→ Cleaner output

Sometimes deleting is shipping.

## Example 7: Announcement with Numbers

15.6M tokens used out of 40M. That's 39%.

Z.AI's Lite plan gives me:
→ 40M tokens/month
→ 100 hours of API time
→ Real-time monitoring via zai-quota

Halfway through February and I've barely used half my quota.

Need to build more things 🏗️
