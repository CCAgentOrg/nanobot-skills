## Usage Tips

1. **Match the hook to the content** - Don't use a curiosity hook for a straightforward announcement
2. **Keep hooks short** - 1-2 lines max
3. **Make it authentic** - Don't use clickbait that doesn't deliver
4. **Test different types** - Questions work well for engagement, statements for authority
5. **Consider your audience** - Devs respond to different hooks than marketers

## Combining Hooks

You can layer hook types:
- Question + Number: "Why do 90% of devs [X]?"
- Statement + Data: "Most people get [X] wrong. Here's why..."
- Story + Curiosity: "I used to [X]. Then I discovered [Y]."
